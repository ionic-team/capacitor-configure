## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 10637dc: Changed merge algorithm for XML operations. This is a breaking change.

  ## New XML Merge Algorithm (breaking)

  The merge operation was changed to support deep trees and fix some issues with the past algorithm. To do this, a breaking change was required in that a matching root tag should be supplied to merge the two trees. In the old format this was not required.

  ## Old format:

  ```yaml
  xml:
    - file: file.xml
      target: entries/field
      merge: |
        <string>Value</string>
  ```

  ## New format:

  ```yaml
  xml:
    - file: file.xml
      target: entries/field
      merge: |
        <field>
          <string>Value</string>
        </field>
  ```

### Major Changes

- This update adds support for arbitrary plist files. Use the `file` field to reference a plist file relative to the native iOS project path.

  This update also had some internal refactoring which has impacted some public types to make them stronger and more concrete, and removes a few legacy operation aliases.

  ## Breaking Changes

  **`@trapezedev/configure`**

  The `infoPlist` operation for `ios` was removed. This was just an alias for `plist` Use the `plist` operation

  **`@trapezedev/project`**

  `JsonFile.getData()` was renamed to `getDocument()` to be more consistent with the other file wrappers.

  VFS types have been made more concrete and data stored in the VFS must now be either a `string` or extend `VFSStorable`.
